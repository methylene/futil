futil
=====

Some classes I found myself repeating across several projects. Most of this stuff is related to JSF.

Install maven artifact like this:

	mvn clean install

then use it in your pom.xml

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.meth4j.futil</groupId>
		<artifactId>futil</artifactId>
		<version>0.0.3</version>
	</dependency>

[futil-square-validator](https://github.com/methylene/futil-square-validator) is an example project.
